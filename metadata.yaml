description: "The American Senator is a novel written in 1875 by Anthony Trollope.\
  \ Although not one of Trollope's better-known works, it is notable for its depictions\
  \ of rural English life and for its many detailed fox hunting scenes. In its anti-heroine,\
  \ Arabella Trefoil, it presents a scathing but ultimately sympathetic portrayal\
  \ of a woman who has abandoned virtually all scruples in her quest for a husband.\
  \ Through the eponymous Senator, Trollope offers comments on the irrational aspects\
  \ of English life.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
